SQLite Virtual Libraries
====

A plugin for [Logitech Media Server](https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver)<br>

Use custom SQLite definitions to create virtual libraries with optional browse menus[^1]. Not actively maintained at the moment.
<br>

[^1]: Browse menus are provided by LMS. Under certain circumstances you may see (empty) albums or artists in some menus that shouldn't be there. There's nothing I can do about it because LMS creates and provides these menus. Just go down one level: click to show all tracks/albums.

**More information and instructions on the plugin's setting page.**

## Installation

You have to [install the plugin manually](https://github.com/AF-1/sobras/wiki/Manual-installation-of-LMS-plugins).
